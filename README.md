## What is Unwrapped?

Unwrapped is a polished full-stack web application that allows users to create and organize gift wishlists for friends, family, etc. The application can be used for any kind of occasion, such as birthdays, wedding registries, or even housewarming gifts. Users will be able to stop guessing, and start giving the perfect gift.

## Technologies Used

Unwrapped was built using Python with Flask as its backend framework and SQLAlchemy as its ORM. Unwrapped uses Javascript, React, and Redux as its frontend, using both Python and Javascript through the use of proxy.

## Conclusion & Moving Forward

Unwrapped was an application that I had set, in my mind, since the beginning of my software engineering journey. From the beginning to the end, it was a project that was always challenging and inspiring me to continue learning and adapting through success and failure. This project comes from a personal experience of never knowing what to get my friends/family on their birthday or Christmas. To avoid that awkward moment of asking, this was an idea that came in mind, having a platform to share and create wish lists that are so specific, you dont't have to do anything but click that link. I am excited to share this with my group of friends and be ableto find ways to upgrade the application moving forward.

Another note, I loved seeing my personal growth and self-doubt dissipate throughout the process of the development. It was exciting to understand how certain code worked and didn't work, while going back and forth between documentation and past notes. This is what I believe is the success found in projects like this, self confidence. 

Moving forward, I would love to implement a way of making sure that the application can track if a gift has already been purchased by another friend/family member/coworker/etc. This would prevent duplicate gifts for a user, and create more functioanlity to the application, with smoother user experience. I have already implemented a purchased data type field set to a boolean in the database, and will move forward with this functiaonlity, by storing it in the redux store and accessing the saved state data. Possibly, by using a checkmark input box. I am very excited to continue with the project.
